Here are the steps to follow: 1. Select a model and a loss function. 2. Split your data into training and validation sets. 3. Feed the training data to the model and optimize the loss function using an optimization algorithm. 4. Evaluate the model on the validation set. 5. Fine-tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters. 6. Test the model on the test set."
